# Frontend Mentor - E-commerce product page

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a solution to the [E-commerce product page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ecommerce-product-page-UPsZ9MJp6). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## Overview

This challenge was gotten from Frontend Mentor and facilitated by Andrew James Okpainmo.

**To do this challenge, you need a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TailwindCSS and React.**

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![]()

### Links

- Solution URL: (https://github.com/Daslaw/e-commerce.git)
- Live Site URL:(https://daslaw.github.io/e-commerce/)

## My process

- Write and Format the Project with Create-React-App
- Styling with TailwindCSS
- Pushed and hosted on GITHUB

### Built with

- - [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS
### Tools
- VScode
- Chrome Browser

### What I learned

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`
### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
